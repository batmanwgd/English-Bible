A History of the English Bible
================================

I've created a timeline of the history of the English Bible. 

I became interested in this in 2011 with the celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the King James Version. Since then, I've tried to stay abreast of developments with the many major English translations on the market since 1950 as well, although I'm probably missing a few translations here and there. Some of the more recent translations have their own interesting histories, which I've tried to reflect in the timeline entries.
